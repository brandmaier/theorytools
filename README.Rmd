The `theorytools` package offers
an integrated suite of tools for creating, maintaining, and reusing
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) theories in R.
Designed to support transparent and collaborative theory development,
the package enables users to formalize theories,
track changes with version control,
assess pre-empirical coherence,
and derive testable hypotheses.
Aligning with open science principles and workflows,
theorytools facilitates the systematic improvement of theoretical frameworks
and enhances their discoverability and usability.

## Installation

You can install the development version of theorytools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("cjvanlissa/theorytools")
```

## Documentation

Every user-facing function in the package is documented, and the documentation can be accessed by running `?function_name` in the R console, e.g., `?bain`.

Moreover, you can read the *Introduction to bain* vignette by running `vignette("Introduction_to_bain", package = "bain")`
