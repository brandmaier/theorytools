  abstract = {Psychology endeavors to develop theories of human capacities and behaviors on the basis of a variety of methodologies and dependent measures. We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined?what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.},

  abstract = {Computational reproducibility is the ability to obtain identical results from the same data with the same computer code. It is a building block for transparent and cumulative science because it enables the originator and other researchers, on other computers and later in time, to reproduce and thus understand how results came about, while avoiding a variety of errors that may lead to erroneous reporting of statistical and computational results. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how the R package repro supports researchers in creating fully computationally reproducible research projects with tools from the software engineering community. Building upon this notion of fully automated reproducibility, we present several applications including the preregistration of research plans with code (Preregistration as Code, PAC). PAC eschews all ambiguity of traditional preregistration and offers several more advantages. Making technical advancements that serve reproducibility more widely accessible for researchers holds the potential to innovate the research process and to help it become more productive, credible, and reliable.},
