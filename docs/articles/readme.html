<p>A README file will often be the first point of contact for users of
any project, including FAIR theories. It should contain all information
people need to get started with using your FAIR theory. A README is a
basic form of documentation with directions on how to use a FAIR theory.
It serves as a guide for others to understand, evaluate, and build upon
your work. A comprehensive and clear README file is essential for making
your FAIR theory accessible and reusable.</p>
<p>Below, we outline the key sections to include in a README file for a
FAIR theory:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="title">1. Title<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#title"></a>
</h3>
<p>Provide a clear title for your theory. We recommend prefacing the
title with the words <code>FAIR theory:</code>, just like a systematic
review should have the words <code>systematic review</code> in the
title, to help sentient readers immediately identify it as such.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="description">2. Description<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#description"></a>
</h3>
<p>Provide a plain-text description of the theory and its scope. This
could be a one- to two-sentence summary of what the theory explains or
predicts, and the context or field of study where the theory
applies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="interoperability">3. Interoperability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interoperability"></a>
</h3>
<p>Most README files contain a section labeled “Getting Started”,
“Instructions for Use”, or “How to Use”. From a FAIR perspective, such a
section might be better labeled “Interoperability”. We propose using
this section to explicitly address the theory’s X-interoperability,
telling users exactly what they can use the theory for, and how.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>X-interoperability:</strong> Tells you what you can do with a
theory, and how.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="contributing">4. Contributing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#contributing"></a>
</h3>
<p>Pertaining to the Reusability criterion of the FAIR principles, this
section should tell users the <em>social expectations regarding reuse
and contributions</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="license">5. License<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#license"></a>
</h3>
<p>The legal complement to the preceding <em>Contributing</em> section,
this section should refer readers to the LICENSE file to learn about the
<em>legal conditions of reuse</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="citing-this-work">6. Citing this Work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#citing-this-work"></a>
</h3>
<p>Tell users how to cite the theory. Note that this section is
redundant with the Zenodo archive, which has a preferred citation field.
The disadvantage of redundant information is that you may have to
maintain this section of the README going forward. The advantage is that
documenting related works in the README makes it more readily accessible
to users. We suggest a compromise: retain this section, but use it to
direct the reader to the preferred citation on the Zenodo page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="related-works">7. Related Works<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#related-works"></a>
</h3>
<p>This section should refer to the work that the FAIR theory is derived
from, or documented in. Again, this is redundant with metadata entered
in Zenodo. We nevertheless recommend using this section to direct the
reader to Zenodo, and optionally, to document one canonical reference
for the theory that is unlikely to change going forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="example-the-empirical-cycle">Example: The Empirical Cycle<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-the-empirical-cycle"></a>
</h2>
<p>Below, we break down the README file of our implementation of De
Groot’s empirical cycle as a FAIR theor:</p>
<p>The title is prefaced with <code>FAIR theory</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="co"># FAIR theory: The Empirical Cycle</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The description gives further information about the theory and its
scope:</p>
<pre><code>## Description

This is a FAIR implementation of De Groot and Spiekerman's "empirical cycle" theory, a theory of cumulative knowledge acquisition through scientific research.</code></pre>
<p>The Interoperability section tells readers how the theory is
implemented, and in which ways it can be reused:</p>
<pre><code>## Interoperability

The theory is implemented in the DOT language for describing graphs.

### Rendering the theory using graphviz

See the graphviz manual for more information: https://graphviz.org
</code></pre>
<p>There are specific instructions on how to contribute to the
project:</p>
<pre><code>## Contributing

<p>The preferred citation section only directs readers to Zenodo to
prevent redundancy:</p>
